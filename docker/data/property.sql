It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

Fisherman sell their catch each evening at the point and to local restaurants.  There are no chains here- no big box stores, no McDonald's.  Everything is fresh and local.  Small vegetable & fruit stands abound, as do eateries and small shops.  Take in a soccer game at the field in the village's center.  Grab a cocktail at a thatch-roofed bar and experience the local fare at one of the dozens of open-air restaurants on the beach, sidewalk, and main road.  Local tour operators offer excursions to go fishing, snorkeling, diving, tubing, hiking, zip-lining, paddle-boarding, and just about any other outdoor activity you can think of.  Happy Exploring!!

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

Brownstones from the nineteenth century line the streets, many of which are occupied by commercial tenants who have been there for decades, giving the street a decidedly vintage feel. This once-rustic neighborhood features cobblestone intersections that add to is Greenwich ambiance. <br /><br />Residents lunch at cafes during the day, enjoy cocktails and shop in the numerous boutiques.

Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral.

Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

This is one of the few areas of the island where you can walk the beach, without divisions by fences and bulkheads, and where the water meets the sand offering a beach and not bulkhead or seawall.  We are a quick 20 minute golf cart ride (and even shorter boat ride) to and from town, making it easy to go to town for shopping or dinner. However, there are several great restaurants and bars within walking distance (like Rojo Lounge, Sundiver Bar, Mambos at Mata Chica, etc.), and once you experience the peace and serenity that Still Waters offers, you may find yourself not wanting to leave the property!  Mata Grande grocery store is a two minute walk away and also offers grocery delivery services.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

In the 19th century, Napoleon Bonaparte had the first two docks excavated for an important naval base. This is followed by an intense flowering period in which several other docks will be excavated.<br />In the 20th century the port activities shift to the North. Most people move away and the « Eilandje » is a deserted area between port and city.<br /><br />At the end of the 20th century, one can see the potential of the abandoned docks, quays and warehouses. The city writes, together with the organization "City on the River" an international architectural competition and in the early 1990s the Spanish architect Manuel de Solà-Morales draws an initial plan for The Island. In 1997 René Daniel's works out concrete plans for the Old Docks, the Montevideo district and the Cadix district. In 2002 the « Eilandje » gets its own Master Plan.<br /><br />Nice website : (URL HIDDEN)<br />On th	Antwerpen	Antwerp	Belize	51.23188	4.40614	68.00	\N	\N	https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/108450211/0ffb89a3_original.jpg	[]	\N	[]	\N	[]	Astrid	https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/34924663/profile_pic/1433367885/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium	\N	t	\N

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

The street is situated between the Zwijger- and the Verbondstraat and is seperated by the De Vrièrestraat. Historically the name of the street was Vaderlandstraat but was renamed in 1891 after Aimé Coquilhat (1853-1891) who was vice governor of the former Belgian colony.<br />The Coquilhatstraat has the typical profile of a street at 'the Zuid', with a construction of late 19th century neoclassical cornices alternated with brick gables and with a monumental building as eyecatcher (source: inventaris onroerenderfgoed).

Parks and squares are being redone. In fact, the street in front of our building had to go. It was changed into a park with green grass, trees and playgrounds. You'll find the excellent bar September Lokaal on this square. Plaza Real is a small, rock-'n-roll kind of bar with a concerthall in the back called 'Pekfabriek', just around the corner. For the hipster Bar Leon in an adjoining park/square  you'll cross one street. There's Mokkakapot, Mombassa, Eco-Café, Bar Luca, De Frieterij (french fries in style), Bistro Miro (make your reservations well in advance, it's ever sold out), Pepper & Mint... One of the largest art galleries of Belgium is hidden here, together with a lot of great alternative galleries and art spaces.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

You can also easily visit the trendy Eilandje and MAS with lots of restaurants, bars and nice views. In the evening, when the sun goes down, we really recommand a visit to the riverbanks of 'Schelde'. It's really amazing to see the sun go down. It's a five minutes walk to get to the river banks and the 'Steen' for example, where you have a stunning view.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

Taste the old atmosphere of the unloading quay with monumental warehouses, lanterns, hangars and cobblestones. Even if you are familiar with this fast-changing neighbourhood, we recommend that you return regularly because things change so quickly. <br /><br />Thanks to three crowd-pullers, the MAS | Museum aan de Stroom, the Red Star Line Museum and the Port House, the link between the city and the water is underlined once more.<br /><br />Het Eilandje is the northernmost neighbourhood of Antwerp. The Port of Antwerp used to be located here, after it slowly moved out of the city centre. So here you will find several docks, some even ordered by Napoleon Bonaparte! And around the docks, you can see the many house-high warehouses, which have now been transformed into fancy lofts.<br /><br />Het Eilandje i	Antwerpen	Antwerp	Belize	51.22763621309178	4.405656484655758	204.00	\N	\N	https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-684550173839793759/original/49ecbe8a-e0c7-4be7-acb5-f429bd006797.jpeg	[]	\N	[]	\N	[]	Mya	https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/1e4ddd33-7e6d-4eb2-98d1-1af6629344ec.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium	\N	t	\N

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

In veel gevallen komt men vooral om te sfeer te proeven. Serieus inkopen doen is niet altijd aan de orde. Het toeristische karakter is vooral duidelijk zichtbaar in het veranderde aanbod. Vogelen, pluimvee en knaagdieren koop je alleen nog maar in het hart van de Graanmarkt. Voor de rest zijn het vooral algemeen handelswaren, kleding, lekkernijen en accessoires wat je in de stands ziet.

You can see the beach from the pool and it is one of the most tranquil places I have ever been.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral.

In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

Hopkins is a wonderful community with a unique Garifuna culture, come to Hopkins with that in mind, embrace a different land and culture, and you will love it.<br />If you are looking for an isolated, or resort experience, for your vacation, then we may not be the right place for you.<br />Being in the village can sometimes mean you will hear children, dogs, radios, chicken and roosters, and we do have a restaurant that has opened up next door that sometimes plays loud music, but mostly you will hear the breeze through the palm trees and the sound of the waves.

Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

The pool, perhaps the largest on the entire island, is where I like to relax and enjoy the nighttime sky’s thousands of stars. You can see the beach from the pool and it is one of the most tranquil places I have ever been.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral.

We are in the village of Hopkins, which is part of the charm I think, but I also know that it is not what everybody is looking for. Hopkins is still very much a village community, not a resort tourist destination, but it is a wonderful community with a unique Garifuna culture. Come to Hopkins with that in mind, embrace a different land and culture, and you will love it. If you are looking for a resort style vacation, then we may not be the right place for you. Being in the village can sometimes mean you will hear children, dogs, radios, chicken and roosters, but mostly you will hear the breeze through the palm trees and the sound of the waves.

The resort is on an island off the coast of Belize, just over a mile south of San Pedro Town, which is far enough from the hustle and bustle to provide a truly tranquil setting and its own private beach access (the cove shaped beach is over 300ft long!). The pool, perhaps the largest on the entire island, is where I like to relax and enjoy the nighttime sky’s thousands of stars. You can see the beach from the pool and it is one of the most tranquil places I have ever been. The island has almost no cars, mostly golf carts, making it quiet and serene as well as environmentally friendly.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe’s most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of café-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp’s top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

The area does not have a touristy vibe. Beware that Belize is a developing country and minimum wage is low.  This means that few people can afford a house of their own and often more than 1 family live on a property under sometimes poor conditions. <br /><br />Caye Caulker is a small island and the main restaurants, shops, supermarkets, dive-/snorkel tour operators are about a 15-25 minute walk or a 10-15 minute bike ride away. In the area close to the house are a few small food stalls and the nearest grocery store is a few minutes by bike. On rainy days (yes, we have them, it's the tropics after all) the roads can be a challenge with slippery potholes and big puddles, but if you like a bit of adventure it will be no problem at all.
