It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe‚Äôs most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of caf√©-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp‚Äôs top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

Guatemala is just a stone‚Äôs throw away, but you could stay for months without having to cross over the border to find new things to do.<br /><br />Cayo used to be the beating heart of the Maya civilization in Belize, and that means that there are still plenty of well-preserved ruins to explore.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe‚Äôs most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of caf√©-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp‚Äôs top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe‚Äôs most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of caf√©-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp‚Äôs top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe‚Äôs most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of caf√©-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp‚Äôs top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

In the 19th century, Napoleon Bonaparte had the first two docks excavated for an important naval base. This is followed by an intense flowering period in which several other docks will be excavated.<br />In the 20th century the port activities shift to the North. Most people move away and the ¬´ Eilandje ¬ª is a deserted area between port and city.<br /><br />At the end of the 20th century, one can see the potential of the abandoned docks, quays and warehouses. The city writes, together with the organization "City on the River" an international architectural competition and in the early 1990s the Spanish architect Manuel de Sol√†-Morales draws an initial plan for The Island. In 1997 Ren√© Daniel's works out concrete plans for the Old Docks, the Montevideo district and the Cadix district. In 2002 the ¬´ Eilandje ¬ª gets its own Master Plan.<br /><br />Nice website : (URL HIDDEN)<br />On th	Antwerpen	Antwerp	Belize	51.23188	4.40614	68.00	\N	\N	https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/108450211/0ffb89a3_original.jpg	[]	\N	[]	\N	[]	Astrid	https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/34924663/profile_pic/1433367885/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium	\N	t	\N

In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe‚Äôs most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of caf√©-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp‚Äôs top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

Historically the name of the street was Vaderlandstraat but was renamed in 1891 after Aim√© Coquilhat (1853-1891) who was vice governor of the former Belgian colony.<br />The Coquilhatstraat has the typical profile of a street at 'the Zuid', with a construction of late 19th century neoclassical cornices alternated with brick gables and with a monumental building as eyecatcher (source: inventaris onroerenderfgoed).

For the hipster Bar Leon in an adjoining park/square  you'll cross one street. There's Mokkakapot, Mombassa, Eco-Caf√©, Bar Luca, De Frieterij (french fries in style), Bistro Miro (make your reservations well in advance, it's ever sold out), Pepper & Mint...

Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of caf√©-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp‚Äôs top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

You can also easily visit the trendy Eilandje and MAS with lots of restaurants, bars and nice views. In the evening, when the sun goes down, we really recommand a visit to the riverbanks of 'Schelde'. It's really amazing to see the sun go down.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe‚Äôs most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of caf√©-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp‚Äôs top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe‚Äôs most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of caf√©-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp‚Äôs top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

Iedere zondag komen er duizenden voornamelijk Nederlandse en Belgische bezoekers naar de Antwerpse Theaterbuurt om tussen de honderden stand te wandelen. In veel gevallen komt men vooral om te sfeer te proeven. Serieus inkopen doen is niet altijd aan de orde. Het toeristische karakter is vooral duidelijk zichtbaar in het veranderde aanbod. Vogelen, pluimvee en knaagdieren koop je alleen nog maar in het hart van de Graanmarkt. Voor de rest zijn het vooral algemeen handelswaren, kleding, lekkernijen en accessoires wat je in de stands ziet. Naast nieuwe producten vind je ook kraampjes met antiek, brocante en tweedehands spullen op de Vogeltjesmarkt.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe‚Äôs most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens.

Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of caf√©-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral.

Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of caf√©-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe‚Äôs most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of caf√©-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp‚Äôs top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

Come to Hopkins with that in mind, embrace a different land and culture, and you will love it. If you are looking for a resort style vacation, then we may not be the right place for you. Being in the village can sometimes mean you will hear children, dogs, radios, chicken and roosters, but mostly you will hear the breeze through the palm trees and the sound of the waves.

The resort is on an island off the coast of Belize, just over a mile south of San Pedro Town, which is far enough from the hustle and bustle to provide a truly tranquil setting and its own private beach access (the cove shaped beach is over 300ft long!). The pool, perhaps the largest on the entire island, is where I like to relax and enjoy the nighttime sky‚Äôs thousands of stars. You can see the beach from the pool and it is one of the most tranquil places I have ever been. The island has almost no cars, mostly golf carts, making it quiet and serene as well as environmentally friendly.

It has long been a powerful magnet for everyone from fashion moguls and club queens to art lovers and diamond dealers. In the mid-16th century it was one of Europe‚Äôs most important cities and home to baroque superstar painters like Pieter Paul Rubens. Despite many historical travails thereafter and severe WWII bombing, Antwerp retains an intriguing medieval heart with plenty of caf√©-filled cobbled lanes, a riverside fortress and a truly impressive Cathedral. Today, however, Antwerp‚Äôs top drawcards are its vibrant fashion and entertainment scene, booming diamond businesses along with its startling architectural and cultural contrasts.

Although we are only 10 minutes from San Ignacio Town, and across the river and just a mile upstream from Cristo Rey Village, you will feel like you are on a tropical island.  Unless wedding sounds waft across the river from the village, the only sounds you will hear will be from the surrounding abundant nature.  The many birds and occasional Howler Monkeys will provide you with a unique cacophony.  We hope you enjoy it.  It‚Äôs usually cool at night, so if you leave the fully screened windows open, the sound of nature will lull you to sleep.  And nature will clearly announce sunrise!
